## What is it?

This repository is the result of four modules of the *HTML/CSS* course in **Alura** platform, these being:

- [ðŸ“š HTML5 and CSS3 part 1: create a web page](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/html5-css3-primeiros-passos)
- [ðŸ“š HTML5 and CSS3 part 2: positioning, lists and navigation](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/html5-css3-posicionamento-listas-navegacao)
- [ðŸ“š HTML5 and CSS3 part 3: working with forms and tables](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/html5-css3-formularios-tabelas)
- [ðŸ“š HTML5 and CSS3 part 4: advancing in CSS](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/html5-css3-avancando-css)

The purpose of these courses was to create the **Alura Barbershop** website following the teachings from instructor **Pedro Marins**.

## Differences

I decided to change all the content, *classes* and *IDs* to **English** (originally **Portuguese**), and I took the liberty of being original with some class names.

And I also decided to separate the **CSS content** by listing it by pages.

Hope you **enjoy** the result as much I've enjoyed the process!
